Hey ! 👋
<br>My name is Sebastian but you can call me Ctrix ! Im a student 👨‍🎓 full-stack developper 👨‍💻
and an investigator 🕵️ at my spare time !</br>
<br>As you can imagine, I think out of the box, I don't like receiving information that has already been processed. or which I can't check. (And no, I don't make 8bit music.👾) </br>
<br>What ? Disappointed ? I said different thinking, not genius or reinventing the wheel. </br>
Yes, just a normal guy doing his best to learn and improve ! If you have any advice or tips, I'd love to hear from you ⚡🧠!
